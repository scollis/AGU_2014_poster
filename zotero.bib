	abstract = {Mechanisms through which atmospheric aerosols affect cloud microphysics, dynamics and precipitation are investigated using a spectral microphysics two-dimensional cloud model. A significant effect of aerosols on cloud microphysics and dynamics has been found. Maritime aerosols lead to a rapid formation of raindrops that fall down through cloud updraughts increasing the loading in the lower part of a cloud. This is, supposedly, one of the reasons for comparatively low updraughts in maritime convective clouds. An increase in the concentration of small cloud condensation nuclei ({CCN}) leads to the formation of a large number of small droplets with a low collision rate, resulting in a time delay of raindrop formation. Such a delay prevents a decrease in the vertical velocity caused by the falling raindrops and thus increases the duration of the diffusion droplet growth stage, increasing latent heat release by condensation. The additional water that rises to the freezing level increases latent heat release by freezing. As a result, clouds developing in continental-type aerosol tend to have larger vertical velocities and to attain higher levels.The results show that a decrease in precipitation efficiency of single cumulus clouds arising in micro-physically continental air is attributable to a greater loss of the precipitating mass due to a greater sublimation of ice and evaporation of drops while they are falling from higher levels through a deep layer of dry air outside cloud updraughts. By affecting precipitation, atmospheric aerosols influence the net heating of the atmosphere. Simulations show that aerosols also change the vertical distribution of latent heat release, increasing the level of the heating peak.Clouds arising under continental aerosol conditions produce as a rule stronger downdraughts and stronger convergence in the boundary layer. Being triggered by larger dynamical forcing, secondary clouds arising in microphysically continental air are stronger and can, according to the results of simulations, form a squall line. The squall line formation was simulated both under maritime ({GATE}-74) and continental ({PRE}-{STORM}) thermodynamic conditions. In the maritime aerosol cases, clouds developing under similar thermodynamic conditions do not produce strong downdraughts and do not lead to squall line formation.Thus, the ‘aerosol effect’ on precipitation can be understood only in combination with the ‘dynamical effect’ of aerosols. Simulations allow us to suggest that aerosols, which decrease the precipitation efficiency of most single clouds, can contribute to the formation of very intensive convective clouds and thunderstorms (e.g. squall lines, etc.) accompanied by very high precipitation rates. Affecting precipitation, net atmospheric heating and its vertical distribution, as well as cloud depth and cloud coverage, atmospheric aerosols (including anthropogenic ones) influence atmospheric motions and radiation balance at different scales, from convective to, possibly, global ones.

	abstract = {{AbstractDuring} the late afternoon on 16 November 2008 the Brisbane (Queensland, Australia) suburb of ?The Gap? experienced extensive wind damage caused by an intense local thunderstorm. The {CP}2 research radar nearby detected near-surface radial velocities exceeding 43 m s?1 above The Gap while hail size reports did not exceed golf ball size, and no tornadoes were reported. The storm environment was characterized by a layer of very moist near-surface air and strong storm-relative low-level flow, whereas the storm-relative winds aloft were weak. While the thermodynamic storm environment contained a range of downdraft-promoting ingredients such as a {\textasciitilde}4-km-high melting level above a {\textasciitilde}2-km-deep layer with nearly dry-adiabatic lapse rates mostly collocated with dry ambient air, a {\textasciitilde}1-km-deep stable layer near the ground would generally lower expectations of destructive surface winds based on the downburst mechanism. Once observed reflectivities exceed 70 {dBZ}, downdraft cooling due to hail melting and downdraft acceleration based on hail loading are found to likely become nonnegligible forcing mechanisms. The event featured the close proximity of a hydrostatically and dynamically driven mesohigh at the base of the downdraft to a dynamically driven mesolow associated with a low-level circulation. This proximity was instrumental in the anisotropic horizontal acceleration of the near-ground outflow and the ultimate strength of the Gap storm surface winds. Weak storm-relative midlevel winds are speculated to have allowed the downdraft to descend close to the low-level circulation, which set up this strong horizontal perturbation pressure gradient.},

It is essential that these fine scale models be constrained by observations of the real atmosphere. However, due to the stochastic nature of convective systems simple one-to-one comparisons are not often possible. To this end a series of observational targets for fine scale models must be developed. These targets represent a common ground between what is achievable from the model and retrievable from the remote sensors. This presentation will show precipitation morphology based targets from the Scanning {ARM} Precipitation Sensitive Radars and and the Weather Forecasting and Research cloud resolving model. Data from a variety of sites will be analyzed using a variety of microphysical schemes and modeling paradigms.},

	abstract = {Clouds play a critical role in the Earth's climate, general atmospheric circulation, and global water balance. Clouds are essential elements in mesoscale meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, air pollution, atmosphericradiation, and weather forecasting, and thus must be understood by any student or researcher in the atmospheric sciences. Cloud Dynamics provides a skillful and comprehensive examination of the nature of clouds--what they look like and why, how scientists observe them, and the basic dynamics and physics that underlie them. The book describes the mechanics governing each type of cloud that occurs in Earth's atmosphere, and the organization of various types of clouds in larger weather systems such as fronts, thunderstorms, and hurricanes.This book is aimed specifically at graduate students, advanced undergraduates, practicing researchers either already in atmospheric science or moving in from a related scientific field, and operational meteorologists. Some prior knowledge of atmospheric dynamics and physics is helpful, but a thorough overview of the necessary prerequisites is supplied. Key Features * Key Highlights of This Text * Provides a complete treatment of clouds integrating the analysis of air motions with cloud structure, microphysics, and precipitation mechanics * Describes and explains the basic types of clouds and cloud systems that occur in the atmosphere-fog, stratus, stratocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, cirrus, thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, orographically induced clouds, mesoscale convection complexes, hurricanes, fronts, and extratropical cyclones * Presents a photographic guide, presented in the first chapter, linking the examination of each type of cloud with an image to enhance visual retention and understanding * Summarizes the fundamentals, both observational and theoretical, of atmospheric dynamics, thermodynamics, cloud microphysics, and radar meteorology, allowing each type of cloud to be examined in depth * Integrates the latest field observations, numerical model simulations, and theory * Supplies a theoretical treatment suitable for the advanced undergraduate or graduate level},

This presentation will focus on the understanding of the physical processes surrounding precipitation rocesses and will cover a wide range of topics from operational implementation of retrieval algorithms on mid to large scale resources ({\textgreater} 40 cores) to using forward models integrated within the retrieval framework for both quality control and experiment design purposes. Finally this presentation will underscore the vital role of community-based software in serving the research community in building sustainable long lifecycle code.},

The forecasts exhibit biases in surface air temperature and precipitation within 3 days which appear to be similar to the climate bias. With the model simulating realistic evaporation but underestimated precipitation, a deficit in soil moisture results which amplifies the initial temperature bias through feedbacks with the land surface. The underestimate of precipitation may be associated with an inability of the model to simulate the eastward propagation of convection from the front-range of the Rocky Mountains and is insensitive to an increase of horizontal resolution from 2° to 0.5° latitude.},

Large concentrations of human-made aerosols have been reported to both decrease and increase rainfall as a result of their radiative and {CCN} activities. At one extreme, pristine tropical clouds with low {CCN} concentrations rain out too quickly to mature into long-lived clouds. On the other hand, heavily polluted clouds evaporate much of their water before precipitation can occur, if they can form at all given the reduced surface heating resulting from the aerosol haze layer. We propose a conceptual model that explains this apparent dichotomy.},

Operation at low fields (B {\textless} 0.2 T) with argon plasmas heated by helicon waves produces plasmas that have large ion Larmor radii (ρi/a {\textasciitilde} 0.4) and show confinement transitions at low power like those in the edge of large devices, yielding fundamental measurements concerning electric fields and zonal flows. At a higher field (0.5 T), precise rotational transform scans with H–He plasmas heated by {ICRF} show resonant equilibrium and stability phenomena which depend on the value of the rotational transform at the radius of zero shear.},

The clustering data is then used to calculate the power spectra of droplet number density fluctuations, which show a dependence on the Taylor microscale-based Reynolds number Reλ and the Stokes number St. First, the Reynolds number dependency of the turbulent clustering influence is investigated for 127 {\textless} Reλ {\textless} 531. The spectra for this wide range of Reλ values reveal that Reλ = 204 is sufficiently large to be representative of the whole wavenumber range relevant for radar observations of atmospheric clouds. We then investigate the Stokes number dependency for Reλ = 204 and propose an empirical model for the turbulent clustering influence assuming power laws for the number density spectrum. For Stokes numbers less than 2, the proposed model can estimate the influence of turbulence on the spectrum with an {RMS} error less than 1 {dB} when calculated over the wavenumber range relevant for radar observations. For larger Stokes number droplets, the model estimate has larger errors, but the influence of turbulence is likely negligible in typical clouds. Applications of the proposed model to two idealized cloud observing scenarios reveal that microscale turbulent clustering can cause a significant error in estimating cloud droplet amounts from radar observations with microwave frequencies less than 13.8 {GHz}.},

	abstract = {Active remote sensors collect complex data sets, which, traditionally, have been further complicated by a lack of community standards. With multiple agencies investing heavily in state of the art sensor technology there is a need to create community standards that enable interoperability across various software suites. The first and easiest approach is a unified file format building on existing community standards. This presentation outlines efforts on the Lidar/Radar Open Source Environment ({LROSE}) at {NCAR} and the {ARM} efforts on the Python {ARM} Radar Toolkit (Py-{ART}) two toolkits, which approach the problem of working with active sensors from two different directions. {LROSE} is a community software project is to provide to the scientific community with a modern, fully-featured software suite for handling radar, profiler and lidar data. While Py‑{ART} uses an abstract python object to allow new modules to be build easily without in-depth knowledge of the data source or internal representation of the data. Current progress will be reported as well as efforts to unify the projects in order to enable end users, not possessing high end programming skills, ease of access to the data.},

We describe an error-minimization technique to identify movement between successive frames of a sequence and we show that we can use the K-Means clusters as the minimization template. A Kalman filter is used to provide smooth estimates of velocity at a pixel through time. Using this technique in combination with the K-Means clusters, we can identify storm motion at different scales and choose different scales to forecast based on the time scale of interest.

The motion estimator has been applied both to reflectivity data obtained from the National Weather Service Radar ({WSR}-88D) and to cloud-top infrared temperatures obtained from {GOES} satellites. We demonstrate results on both these sensors.},

	abstract = {{AbstractThis} study presents radar-based precipitation estimates collected during the two-month {DOE} {ARM} - {NASA} Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment ({MC}3E). Emphasis is on the usefulness of radar observations from the C-band and X-band scanning {ARM} precipitation radars ({CSAPR}, {XSAPR}) for rainfall estimation products to distances within 100 km of the Lamont, Oklahoma {ARM} facility. The study utilizes a dense collection of collocated {ARM}, {NASA}-{GPM} and nearby surface Oklahoma Mesonet gauge records to evaluate radar-based hourly rainfall products and campaign optimized methods over individual gauges and for areal rainfall characterizations. Rainfall products are also evaluated against the performance of a regional {NWS} {WSR}-88D S-band dual-polarization radar product. Results indicate that the {CSAPR} system may achieve similar point and areal-gauge bias and root mean square (rms) error performance to a {WSR}-88D reference for the variety of {MC}3E deep convective events sampled. The best campaign rainfall performance was achieved when using radar relations capitalizing on estimates of the specific attenuation from the {CSAPR} system. The {XSAPRs} demonstrate limited capabilities, having modest success compared to the {WSR}-88D reference for hourly rainfall accumulations under 10 mm. All rainfall estimation methods exhibit a factor of 1.5 to 2.5 reduction in rms errors for areal accumulations over a 15 km2 {NASA} dense gauge network, with the smallest errors typically associated with dual-polarization radar methods.},

	abstract = {Climate modelers generally require meteorological information on regular grids, but monitoring stations are, in practice, sited irregularly. Thus, there is a need to produce public data records that interpolate available data to a high density grid, which can then be used to generate meteorological maps at a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. In addition to point predictions, quantifications of uncertainty are also needed. One way to accomplish this is to provide multiple simulations of the relevant meteorological quantities conditional on the observed data taking into account the various uncertainties in predicting a space-time process at locations with no monitoring data. Using a high-quality dataset of minute-by-minute measurements of atmospheric pressure in north-central Oklahoma, this work describes a statistical approach to carrying out these conditional simulations. Based on observations at 11 stations, conditional simulations were produced at two other sites with monitoring stations. The resulting point predictions are very accurate and the multiple simulations produce well-calibrated prediction uncertainties for temporal changes in atmospheric pressure but are substantially overconservative for the uncertainties in the predictions of (undifferenced) pressure.},

	abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the ultimate change in global mean temperature in response to a change in external forcing. Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

Because it is a U.S. Department of Energy ({DOE}) user facility, {ARM} data are freely available to anyone through the {ARM} Data Archive. With 20 years of operations, the facility recently added two mobile facilities and an aerial facility to its network of fixed-location sites. Research using {ARM} data has led to advances in areas ranging from radiative transfer to cloud microphysics. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allowed {ARM} to enhance its observational capabilities with a broad array of new instruments at its fixed and mobile sites and the aerial facility. Instruments include scanning radars; water vapor, cloud/aerosol extinction, and Doppler lidars; aerosol instruments for measuring optical, physical, and chemical properties; and aircraft probes for measuring cloud and aerosol properties. Taking full advantage of these instruments will involve the development of complex data products. This work is underway but will benefit from engagement with the broader scientific community. This article describes the current status of the {ARM} research capabilities with an emphasis on developments over the past eight years since {ARM} was designated a {DOE} scientific user facility, reviews some of scientific advances made using the {ARM} Facility over the past two decades, and describes the new measurement capabilities and adaptations of the {ARM} facility to make effective use of these capabilities.},

To this end the facility has installed a network of volume scanning radars including radars at C and X band, for retrieval of geophysical parameters pertinent to precipitating systems. This presentation outlines the suite of algorithms used to progress from moment data to model-like three-dimensional geophysical parameters, including quantitative precipitation and three dimensional storm dynamics. Taking advantage of the recent {MC}3E field program, analysis has focused primarily on the Southern Great Plains radar network. However, in addition, some results from Manus Island in the tropical western Pacific and Barrow on the north slope of Alaska will be presented. As retrievals from these systems will be used to improve the cloud and climate models, a particular emphasis will be placed on verification of the retrievals with independent measurements.},

	abstract = {Capsule To date, progress in the use of weather radar observations has been impeded by a lack of community-based software development. Recently, though, several Open Source products have demonstrated that {OSS} can be a real benefit to the radar community. Weather radar analysis has become increasingly sophisticated over the past 50 years, and efforts to keep software up to date have generally lagged behind the needs of the users. We argue that progress has been impeded by the fact that software has not been developed and shared as a community. Recently, the situation has been changing. In this paper, the developers of a number of Open Source Software ({OSS}) projects highlight the potential of {OSS} to advance radar-related research. We argue that the community-based development of {OSS} holds the potential to reduce duplication of efforts, and to create transparency in implemented algorithms while improving the quality and scope of the software. We also conclude that there is sufficiently mature technology to support collaboration across different software projects. This could allow for consolidation towards a set of interoperable software platforms, each designed to accommodate very specific user requirements.},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce {ERA}-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of {ERA}-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at {ECMWF}. Copyright © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {All estimates of aerosol indirect effects on the global energy balance have either completely neglected the influence of aerosol on convective clouds or treated the influence in a highly parameterized manner. Embedding cloud-resolving models ({CRMs}) within each grid cell of a global model provides a multiscale modeling framework for treating both the influence of aerosols on convective as well as stratiform clouds and the influence of clouds on the aerosol, but treating the interactions explicitly by simulating all aerosol processes in the {CRM} is computationally prohibitive. An alternate approach is to use horizontal statistics (e.g., cloud mass flux, cloud fraction, and precipitation) from the {CRM} simulation to drive a single-column parameterization of cloud effects on the aerosol and then use the aerosol profile to simulate aerosol effects on clouds within the {CRM}. Here, we present results from the first component of the Explicit-Cloud Parameterized-Pollutant parameterization to be developed, which handles vertical transport of tracers by clouds. A {CRM} with explicit tracer transport serves as a benchmark. We show that this parameterization, driven by the {CRM}'s cloud mass fluxes, reproduces the {CRM} tracer transport significantly better than a single-column model that uses a conventional convective cloud parameterization.},

	abstract = {The tropical marine {PBL} under the influence of a deep convection system is investigated using a large-domain {LES} that resolves a wide range of scales, from mesoscale cloud clusters down to energy-containing turbulence. The simulated {PBL} is dominated by both turbulence and cloud-induced cold-pools. The variance of vertical velocity in the {PBL} resides mostly in the turbulence scales while that of water vapor mixing ratio resides mostly at the cold-pool scales; however, both turbulence and cold-pool scales contribute about equally to their covariance. The broad scale range of the {LES} flow field is decomposed into the filtered (i.e., cloud system) and the subfilter (i.e., small convection and turbulence) components using a Gaussian filter with various filter widths. Such decomposed flow fields are used to retrieve information of spatial distribution of the subfilter-scale fluxes and their relationship to the filtered field. This information is then used to evaluate the performance of an eddy-viscosity model commonly used in cloud-resolving models. The subfilter-scale fluxes computed from the eddy-viscosity model correlate reasonably with those retrieved from the {LES} in the lower cloud layer but not in the {PBL}; the correlation coefficients between the modeled and the retrieved fluxes are about 0.5 in the lower cloud layer but smaller than 0.2 in the {PBL}.},

	abstract = {It is thought that changes in the concentration of cloud-active aerosol can alter the precipitation efficiency of clouds, thereby changing cloud amount and, hence, the radiative forcing of the climate system. Despite decades of research, it has proved frustratingly difficult to establish climatically meaningful relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation. As a result, the climatic effect of the aerosol remains controversial. We propose that the difficulty in untangling relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation reflects the inadequacy of existing tools and methodologies and a failure to account for processes that buffer cloud and precipitation responses to aerosol perturbations.},

The diagnostics technique is based on the measurement of helium spectral line ratios which are a strong function of electron temperature while being a weak function of electron density. The validation procedure involves comparing measured and calculated emissivities of spectral lines emitted by helium atoms as a function of position in the beam.},
